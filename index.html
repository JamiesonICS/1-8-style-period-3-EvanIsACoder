      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) could be a course all by itself. I have done plenty of CSS in this repo, but particularly along with <a href="https://jamiesonics.github.io/1-5-html-basic-EvanIsACoder/">, my 1.5 repo</a>.

      Once you get to know CSS, you will start using the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag a lot more than the paragraph tag. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag is a placeholder or <em>bucket</em> for HTML that you can style and place anywhere on the page. You can even layer divs on top of each other for interesting effects.
